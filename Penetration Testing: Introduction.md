# Penetration Testing: Introduction

## Overview

Penetration testing is a method of testing used to evaluate the security posture of an organization or client. Penetration Testing campaigns can occur over both short periods and long periods of time and most campaigns have a particular focus or message. Practicing this skill in a controlled environment can bolster ones understanding of both penetration testing and information security concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to be used as a sort of personal tracker. A repository where I can keep information related to any mock test that I perform in my homelab environment. I can see how I'm developing by comparing earlier write-ups with more current ones to see how my knowledge and understanding of concepts grow. I also hope any person who may be viewing can learn something new or answer any question that they might have.

## Contents

This sections contents will include any write-ups, investigation notes, or any other information related to any mock investigations or tests that are performed in my homelab environment. The write-ups are going to be more formal and aimed to be something more akin to an actual report that I would hand in to a client. Investigation notes are going be more along the lines of information dumps. These will contain all of the information gathered during investigations using tools like nmap, nikto, dirbuster, OpenVAS, etc.

## Audience

This document is going to be for a wide-ranging audience. This is for those who are, like myself at the time of writing this, beginners in the information security field but this is also for anybody who may be in search of information. If any of this information is able to teach something or answer a question then the section and the information contained within it are doing their job.

## Prerequisites

Anyone who may be viewing the information contained within this section should have a basic understanding of CLI, Linux and Windows Operating Systems, networking, and virtualization concepts.

## Getting Started

If you are looking to get started doing mock penetration tests and investigations similar to the ones contained in this section, consider following the guides contained within the "Homelab" repo. These guides will teach you how to set up your own virtual environment for testing using VirtualBox. There are plenty of guides on the internet, in case you want to use any of the other Hypervisor options like KVM or VMWare Workstation Pro.
